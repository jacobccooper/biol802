    "text": "2 Introduction\nHardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (or HWE) is a theoretical model designed to look at the “null expectation” for genotype frequencies within a population if no evolution is occurring. Thus, they are a null model against which we can explicitly test observed genotype frequencies to determine if a certain trait is undergoing selection.\nThis work-through is meant to be a hands-on supplemental for Lecture 6 covering Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium.",

All of these programs are available for free, and their requisite packages are likewise free. This document uses R 4.4.1.\nR is a fairly straightforward coding language, and notable prefers the use of “&lt;-” over “=” to define variables to avoid any logical errors (although in many instances these character strings can be interchangeable). R commands are fairly easy to use, and arguments are separated by commas. Here, we will be creating a basic program for studtying HWE.",
