# Preface {.unnumbered}

These are some demonstrations and some extra information that may be useful for BIOL802: Organic Evolution at the University of Nebraska at Kearney. Most of these demonstrations involve use of the program *R* and *RStudio*; these programs are required for BIOL827, but are not necessary for BIOL802 beyond these additional workthroughs.
